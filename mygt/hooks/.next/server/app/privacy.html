collects and uses the Personal Data of its users. We follow all privacy laws and only take the information we need to provide services to our users, which is in our best interest.</p></div></header><main class="mx-auto max-w-[1100px] pb-40"><div class="privacy-container"><h2>1. Introduction</h2><p>This Privacy Policy explains how Virtual X gets and uses personal information. We also explain why we are collecting this information and what rights all of our users have when it comes to their privacy.</p><p>If you choose to use our website, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. Please look over the following meanings before going any further.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>2. Definitions</h2><ul><li>Personal Data is information or data about a person who can be recognised or found. An identifiable person is a real person whose name, ID number, or address can be used directly or indirectly to find out who they are. You can also tell who someone is by things about their cultural, economic, psychological, or social identity. This explanation is the same as GDPR (5th bullet point).</li><li>A Data Controller is the legal entity in charge of deciding what data is gathered, how it is collected, and what it is used for. In this case, Virtual X is the one in charge of the data.</li><li>A Data Processor is a person, business, or other organisation that handles data at the request of a Data Controller. One Data Controller can work with more than one Data Processor at the same time.</li><li>Processing Personal Data means doing anything that has to do with the Personal Data of people. This includes, but is not limited to, getting the data, storing it, processing it, changing it, sending it somewhere else, and getting rid of it.</li><li>The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.</li></ul></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>3. Collecting Personal Data</h2><p>Virtual X gathers Personal Data to help our users and make our website better. We get Personal Data in a number of different ways.</p><p>For example, when you make an account on our website, you give us information like your name and contact information like your email address, phone number, and country of residence. We have to get this information from you so that we can finish setting up your account. Also, if you want to reach us, you&#x27;ll need to fill out the contact form with your information so we can answer your question and help you.</p><p>There is also a chance that Virtual X will collect other, less specific details about you based on your demographics. With this Personal Data, we can find out more about our guests and make their experience better.</p><p>The information you give us is kept private and will only be used in ways that are necessary for our services and website to work. We won&#x27;t share any of your private information without your permission. By making an account, getting in touch with us, or using any of our services, you agree that we can collect your Personal Data.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>4. Processing Personal Data</h2><p>Virtual X can properly use your personal information because of the following:</p><p><span>Contractual: </span>In order to give you our services, we need to get your personal information.</p><p><span>Legal Compliance: </span>We have to collect Personal Data from users because the GDPR and other rules say we have to.</p><p><span>Reasonable Interest: </span>According to the GDPR, we can override your right to privacy if we can show that we have a reasonable interest in collecting your Personal Data.</p><p><span>Consentual Collection:</span>There are times when we may take Personal Data for reasons other than those listed above. In this situation, we&#x27;ll always ask for clear permission.</p><p>Virtual X is not the direct Data Processor and is not in charge of keeping data on its servers. We give your information to the broker who is in charge of you. This broker is the Data Processor and is in charge of everything that has to do with how your data is handled. If you have questions, you should talk to your broker.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>5. The Purpose of Data Collection</h2><p>It&#x27;s important to us that we collect and handle your Personal Data. This is because Personal Data is a key part of making our website and the services we offer better.</p><p><span>The most important reasons for collecting and handling Personal Data are:</span></p><p>To let you use our services, we need to: If you want to make an account on Virtual X, you will need to give your name and a way to get in touch with you. By filling out our signup form, you agree that we can use the information you give us.</p><p>For us to be able to talk to you: If you have questions about our services or want to get in touch with us for any other reason, you will need to fill out a contact form with your information. This makes sure that we can answer your question.</p><p>So that we can let you know about limited-time offers: Virtual X may also offer special deals that are only good for a short time. When a deal is going on, we&#x27;d like to let you know about it. To do this, you&#x27;ll need to tell us how to get in touch with you so we can handle it.</p><p>So that we can improve our site: We&#x27;re always trying to improve how our website works so that it&#x27;s better for you. By gathering and processing your Personal Data, we can find out what parts of our website need to be improved.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>6. Our Use of Cookies</h2><p>Cookies are used by Virtual X to help us improve our website and make sure it works right. Cookies are small files that let us know who is using our website and what device they are using. You can turn off cookies at any time by changing the settings on your browser. However, this may make some services unavailable or not work right.</p><p><span>On this site, you will find the following cookies:</span></p><p><span>Essential Cookies</span></p><p>These cookies make sure that our website&#x27;s services are available and work the way they were meant to. They are the most important kind of cookie, and our site won&#x27;t work right without them.</p><p><span>Google Analytics Cookies</span></p><p>Through our deal with Google, we can use Google Analytics cookies to learn how our website&#x27;s visitors use its features and how they interact with them. This tells us how to improve the website and make it better for our users.</p><p><span>Third-party Cookies</span></p><p>On our website, you may also find cookies from linked brokerages that are owned by third parties. The third-party cookies you see will be from the company you were randomly given when you signed up for an account on our site.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>7. Storage</h2><p>No information is kept on our computers. We make sure to only gather and use the information we need to run our services.</p><p>After making an account, users will be matched with a dealer at random. This broker is the Data Processor and is in charge of processing, keeping, protecting, and deleting your Personal Data. We only work with brokerages that follow all rules about privacy that apply to them. Please keep in mind that these rules may be different in different places where the brokerage works.</p><p>We suggest that you read the Privacy Policy and other policies of the service you have been given.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>8. Protection</h2><p>Virtual X takes strict safety steps to make sure that all Personal Data is kept safe and is only seen by the people who need to see it. We won&#x27;t give your information to anyone else unless the law says we have to. In these situations, we will let people know and ask for their permission.</p><p>In the rare case that a government agency tells us we have to share your Personal Data, we will follow the law and may give this information to the government. Any requests for your Personal Data will be carefully looked over to see if they are valid and if they are more important than the privacy rights of our users.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>9. Third-party Access</h2><p>Only with the user&#x27;s permission does Virtual X share Personal Data with third parties. Any time we share information, we do so in line with all privacy rules.</p><p>The Data Processor(s) handle all of the information about users. This can include the company you&#x27;ve been given as well as third parties like web hosting companies. Please read the Privacy Policy of the company you have been given before using their services.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>10. Your Privacy Rights</h2><p>According to the GDPR and other privacy rules, you have a number of basic rights about how your data is collected and used.</p><p><span>You have the right to do the following with Virtual X:</span></p><p><span>Subject access: </span>You can ask the person in charge of your Personal Data to let you see it.</p><p><span>Restriction: </span>In certain situations, you can ask the Data Controller to limit who can see your Personal Data.</p><p><span>Transfer: </span>You can ask the Data Controller to send your personal information to another person or organisation.</p><p><span>Correction: </span>You can ask the Data Controller to change your Personal Data if you think it was not recorded correctly.</p><p><span>Erase: </span>You can ask the Data Controller and any other people who have access to your Personal Data to get rid of some or all of it.</p><p><span>Complaint: </span>If you think your Personal Data has been mishandled or that the Data Controller has broken any privacy rules in your country, you can file a complaint with the authorities.</p><p>All users also have the right to change their minds about letting their information be collected. They can also challenge the Data Controller&#x27;s claim that they have a reasonable interest in processing their data if the user can show that their right to privacy is more important.</p><p>There may be more privacy laws in the place where you live.</p></div><div class="privacy-container"><h2>11. Policy Amendments</h2><p>This website&#x27;s material, including this Privacy Policy, can change at any time without users being told ahead of time. We may make changes to this Policy, which will go into effect as soon as they are posted. It is up to you to make sure you have the most recent version of this Privacy Policy, because if you keep using this website, you agree to this Policy and our other policies.</p></div><p class="px-4
