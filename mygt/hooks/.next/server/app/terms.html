Acquiring and storing VRL Tokens involves various risks, in particular that Virtual X may not be able to launch some operations and continue developing its network or community. Therefore, and prior to acquiring VRL, any user should carefully consider the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring VRL within the Token Sale, and, if necessary, obtain independent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position to accept nor to understand the risks associated with the activity (incl. the risks related to the non-development of Virtual X network and operations) or any other risks as indicated in the T&amp;C, should not acquire VRL, at this stage or later. </p><p>11.2 Legal Risk concerning Security Regulation. There is a risk that in some jurisdictions VRL  Tokens might be considered as a security, now or in the future. Company does not give warranties or guarantees that VRL Token are not a security in all jurisdictions. Each user of VRL shall bear its own legal or financial consequences of VRL Token being considered a security in their respective jurisdiction. The legal ability of Company to provide VRL Tokens in some jurisdictions may be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event, it turns out with a high degree of certainty that VRL Tokens are not legal in certain jurisdiction, Company will base on its sole discretion either (a) cease operations in that jurisdiction, or (b) adjust VRL Tokens in a way to comply with the regulation should that be possible and viable. It is your obligation to check if acquisition and disposal of VRL Tokens is legal in your jurisdiction, and by accepting these Terms you expressly agree and warrant that you will not use VRL should their use not be legal in the relevant jurisdiction. </p><p>11.3. Risk of malfunction of blockchain. Nobody can guarantee the source code used by Company will be flaw-free. It may contain certain flaws, errors, defects and bugs, which may disable some functionality for users, expose users’ information or otherwise. Such flaw would compromise the usability and/or security of Company and consequently bring adverse impact on the value of Company open source codes rely on transparency to promote community-sourced identification and solution of problems within the code. </p><p>11.4 Update of the Source Code. The source code could be updated, amended, altered or modified from time to time by the developers and/or the community. Nobody is able to foresee or guarantee the precise result of such update, amendment, alteration or modification. As a result, any update, amendment, alteration or modification could lead to an unexpected or unintended outcome that adversely affects VRL Tokens and/or Company operation or market value. </p><p>11.5. Internet transmission risks. You acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilising an Internet-based digital assets, products and website including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections.

To a reasonable extent, Company will be prepared to take proactive or remedial steps to update the protocol underlying Company in response to any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional reasonable security measures where appropriate. It is impossible to predict the future of cryptography or the future of security innovations to an extent that would permit the Company accurately guide the development of Company to take into account such unforeseeable changes in the domains of cryptography or security. </p><p>11.7 Risk of theft and hacking. Hackers or other groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with your third-party wallet, the Website or the availability of VRL Tokens in any number of ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks. </p><p>11.8.

Mining Attacks, as described above, may also target other blockchain networks, with which VRL interacts with. Any successful attacks present a risk to the VRL Token. </p><p>11.9 Risk of loss of value and uninsured losses: Value of VRL Tokens may fluctuate and you may suffer loss in value of such acquired VRL Token. In addition to loss of value risk, VRL Tokens are entirely uninsured and are unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions. </p><p>11.10 Unanticipated risks: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are new and untested technology an in addition to the risk outlined in these Terms, there are also unforeseeable risks that may materialise as unanticipated. </p><p>11.11 You acknowledge, agree and warrant that you have been warned of the potential risks involved by using our services, website and product and other relevant technologies mentioned herein as well as that there may be other risks involved, which are not specified herein and that you fully accept such risks. </p></div></li><li class="text-brandColor">Important Disclaimer:<div><p>12.1 The T&amp;C shall not and cannot be considered as an invitation to enter into an investment.
